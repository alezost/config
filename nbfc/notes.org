This is my config for [[https://github.com/hirschmann/nbfc/][nbfc]] ("Notebook Fan Control").

Some "self-notes" follows...

[[file:Acer Aspire E5-576.xml]] originates from "Acer Aspire E5-575G.xml"
file taken from [[https://github.com/hirschmann/nbfc/pull/651/files]].  It
should be put to [[file:/opt/nbfc/Configs]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo ln -sv ~/config/nbfc/Acer\ Aspire\ E5-576.xml /opt/nbfc/Configs/
#+END_SRC

After starting nbfc service, I got "File Descriptor does not support
writing" error.  This problem was mentioned on the [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Fan_Speed_Control ][ArchWiki page]] and
described [[https://github.com/hirschmann/nbfc/issues/439][here]].  A solution was simply to remove (rename) some library:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
systemctl stop nbfc
sudo mv -v /opt/nbfc/Plugins/StagWare.Plugins.ECSysLinux.dll /opt/nbfc/Plugins/StagWare.Plugins.ECSysLinux.dll.old
systemctl start nbfc
#+END_SRC

Finally, some examples of "nbfc" usage:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
nbfc config -a "Acer Aspire E5-576"
nbfc status
nbfc set -a    # set speed to "auto"
nbfc set -s 0  # turn the fan off
nbfc set -s 10 # turn it to 10%
#+END_SRC
